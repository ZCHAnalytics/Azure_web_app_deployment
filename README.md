A blueprint for getting a React web app with a Node.js API and a MongoDB database running on Azure. The blueprint includes sample application code (a ToDo web app). I modify it slightly and then leverage the Infrastructure as Code assets (written in Bicep) to create a fully functional web app.

I then setup a pipeline and monitor the application.

### Prerequisites
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd-install)
- [Node.js with npm (18.17.1+)](https://nodejs.org/) - for API backend and Web frontend

### Quickstart
I follow the steps in [this quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/get-started?tabs=localinstall&pivots=programming-language-nodejs) with this template(`Azure-Samples/todo-nodejs-mongo`).

This quickstart helps authenticate on Azure, initialize using a template, provision infrastructure and deploy code on Azure via the following commands:

```bash
# Log in to azd. Only required once per-install.
azd auth login

# First-time project setup. Initialize a project in the current directory, using this template. 
azd init --template Azure-Samples/todo-nodejs-mongo

# Provision and deploy to Azure
azd up
```

### Application Architecture

This application utilizes the following Azure resources:

- [**Azure App Services**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/) to host the Web frontend and API backend
- [**Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/mongodb-introduction) for storage
- [**Azure Monitor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/) for monitoring and logging
- [**Azure Key Vault**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/) for securing secrets

Here's a high level architecture diagram that illustrates these components. Notice that these are all contained within a single [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal).

### Application Code

This template is structured to follow the [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/overview). 

### Setup pipelines, monitor your application, test and debug locally.

> Note: Needs to manually install [setup-azd extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azd) for Azure DevOps (azdo).

- [`azd pipeline config`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/configure-devops-pipeline?tabs=GitHub) - to configure a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps) to deploy the application whenever code is pushed to the main branch. 

- [`azd monitor`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/monitor-your-app) - to monitor the application and quickly navigate to the various Application Insights dashboards (e.g. overview, live metrics, logs)

- [Run and Debug Locally](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/debug?pivots=ide-vs-code) - using Visual Studio Code and the Azure Developer CLI extension

- [`azd down`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/reference#azd-down) - to delete all the Azure resources created with this template 

- [Enable optional features, like APIM](./OPTIONAL_FEATURES.md) - for enhanced backend API protection and observability

## Security

### Roles

This template creates a [managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for the app inside the Azure Active Directory tenant. It is used to authenticate the  app with Azure and other services that support Azure AD authentication like Key Vault via access policies. 

### Key Vault

This template uses [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to securely store the Cosmos DB connection string for the provisioned Cosmos DB account. Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets (API keys, passwords, certificates, cryptographic keys) and makes it simple to give other Azure services access to them.
